      	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>
My name is David Hostios (you can call me David, Dave, Hostios, Tostitos, or like my 6th grade gym teacher, Hussatoe, whatever...). I am a family man in Hartselle, Alabama just lucky to have a second chance to get an education actually worth my precious time and hard effort. </p>
<p>I am an artist at heart, but when asked about what kind of artist, all I can really say is "I do art." </p>
<p>
I do visual art - I have an associate's in graphic design, so I do all kinds of logos, signs, photo retouching, and other more traditional graphic design. I also do paintings and drawings. A life-long love of comics has been the inspiration for me to learn acrylic and watercolor paint, charcoal and graphite drawing techniques, and story-boarding and telling. I guess the dream is to one day publish a graphic novel of some kind.
I even did a year at Six Flags in GA drawing caricatures. I learned how to observe faces
for microexpressions and translate that into a product, and I got a sweet airbrush out of the deal. I estimate (conservatively) that I drew 3000 faces in one summer. It was awesome. </p>
<p>
I also do music. Since I was 9 I have played guitar, and in the past 21 years I have picked up piano (though I'm no expert there), mandolin, ukulele, banjo, and bass. Pretty much, if it has strings (and yes, pianos do) I can get you a joyful noise. My love of music has inspired me to write a bunch of original music and I spent a decade of my life playing in 'bar bands' all around the South. </p>
<p>
Educationally, I feel like I've settled and underperformed because of my lack of interest in what I was doing. As an undergrad at Auburn University (when I was a ripe, wide-eyed 18 year old hippie) I had no interest in the Parmacological course of study, but had no better plan, so I wasted about 2 1/2 years taking classes that now serve only to make me a formidable trivia night opponent. I then got an associate's degree in graphic design from a small private institution in downtown Atlanta, but my main education from that time period was really drawing caricatures. The Adobe creative suite stuff was helpful, and I think it's about a 50% chance of somehow being useful at DBC.
</p>
<p>
Instinctively, I don't like to be the center of attention. It creates anxiety for me when everyone turns to me in a room full of people unless I'm on stage - then I don't care, so I guess that's a quirk. 
</p>
<p>
I don't like when people whip out photos of their dogs or cats when I'm talking about my kids. I think it is insulting and rude to compare the two. I have dogs, I get it, fur-babies and all, but until you've got your own, just don't. Not that I get real heated or anything, it's just annoying. Also it wouldn't be a bad thing if I never saw a huge truck on huge wheels with huge pipes blaring huge rap music. May be a southern thing, not sure.</p>
