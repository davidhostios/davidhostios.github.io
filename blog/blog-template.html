-How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
I thought it worked out well because our strengths played towards the final goal of the project. Because I have a design background, I was able to share the process of thumbnailing for initial ideas and Tom was much more proficient writing the HTML code, so he was able to drive for that portion of the challenge. I think it's fair to say we learned something from one another.

-Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes it gave us a clear reference for exactly what to include. It provided us with a guide to making each HTML element.

-What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We started with thumbnails, and kept the purpose of the website in mind while picking the elements that would further the aim of the project. In general, a good wireframe will not only include the elements that work with the goal of the website, but it will allow you to consolidate and simplify extraneous elements as well. 

-What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I learned that you can simplify building a group of navigation tabs using the <nav> tags, but they cannot be placed into the footer.
