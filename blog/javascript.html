				<h1>Post 6 - On Primitives</h1>
				<p>You may be sitting there going "What is a primitive?"
	      		</p>
	      		<h3>I'M GLAD YOU ASKED</h3>
	      		<p>Well, for the purposes of this blog post, it is one thing that Ruby and Javascript have definitely not got in common. There ARE NO PRIMITIVES in Ruby, where everything is an object and the whole language is meant to be easy for us to read and write. How many times in the past did we read something like "Everything in Ruby is an object!" I feel like that should be a footnote to the entire post, so maybe it will be...</p>
	      		<p>In contrast, only objects are objects in Javascript. The rest are whatcha call <em>Primitives.</em></p>
	      		<p>There are exactly five types of primitives, and they are...(I'm gonna assume that if you have made it this far, you might know a little bit about what is going on)</p>
	      		<p>Undefined</p>
	      		<p>Null</p>
	      		<p>Boolean</p>
	      		<p>String</p>
	      		<p>Number</p>
	      		<em>So what does it mean?</em>
	      		<p>Well, not a lot in practice. You can often coerce a property to a primitive and thus make an object, but in practice it is wasteful and often useless. The major advantage of using objects over primitives is that you can assign properties, but that could just lead to confusion.  </p>
	      		<p>Any-who, as useless as allllll this information may have been, I think there is merit in understanding as much as possible about the language we are learning.</p>
