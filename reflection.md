#What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I feel like I got to make personal friends with each of these concepts
during the course of this challenge.

I learned that padding is the space between the content you add and the 
border around the element, and I learned that many elements come 
with built-in settings, like a paragraph will by default have a small
amount of padding on top and bottom. 

I learned that the border can help you define the overall shape of the 
boxes your html elements live in, and it had several handy decorative 
qualities. 

I learned that the margin can be manipulated to change the position
of your elements. Many times, by giving the property margin a value 
of auto, you can center an object such as a div. 

#What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that there are many different approaches to positioning an
HTML element. With so many different manipulations such as clear, 
display, and position, each with their own unique values, a designer 
must consider the future utility of the page to determine how best to 
achieve the desired result. 

#What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I started off with a design idea in mind and found it easy to get the
elements to <em>look</em> like I wanted them to look, but it was
difficult to get them to <em>behave</em> the way I wanted them to. 

I ended up spending a good chunk of time in DevTools figuring out
how to get what I needed to stay put to stay put. 

#What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that you can have more than one stylesheet per page. 
I learned that I like using the margins to help position an element
on the page. I learned what static, relative, fixed, and absolute 
mean in regard to the position of an element. 

-Static is the default setting of an element you create with HTML, 
which is stacked right on top of one another. 

-Relative is used to move it from where it would normally have been. 

-Absolute positioning is using the offset values to position
an element in a fixed position <em>where it lives in its 
containing element</em>, and also removes it from normal flow. 

-Fixed positioning is using the offset values to position
an element in a fixed position <em>in the browser window</em>,
and it too removes it from the normal flow.
